This repository was created for a university exam - Social Network Analysis. While the exam has been completed, the repository remains incomplete and could benefit from further additions or revisions.

## Abstract
Abstract
Social media play a key role in shaping citizensâ€™ political opinion, in particular Twitter is among the few social
networks (if not the only, with millions of users all around the world) that allows its relational data, like the structure
of interactions, for the academic use and analysis. Literature on social networks and elections has focused on predicting
electoral outcomes rather than on understanding how the discussions between users evolve over time. In the present study
we analyse the semantic network observed on Twitter during and after the 2022 Italian political election period and see
how elector dictionary changes. Starting from a corpus of tweets posted by Italian users throughout 6 months (August
2022 - February 2023), we apply different algorithms to analyze first the network formed by users and then what is their
dictionary, trying to see if there are evident differences also in the semantic that users have during the chosen period.
Albeit it is widely acknowledged that Twitter data systematically under-represent the real-world population, there is also
evidence that the political system and the role of the incumbent in the election influences the way conversations on
Twitter occur.

## Requirements
For the realization of the project the following environment
were used: Python in the Jupyter Environment,
with the help of the NetworkX, CDlib and NDlib libraries;
Gephi for the visual representation of the graph.
